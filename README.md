# BetterRoutes #

Welcome to BetterRoutes -- a better way to visualize your Rake Routes table.  It has been tested in Rails 3+.  I'm not sure if it will function on Rails 2.


## Getting Started -- Rails 3+ ##

All you need to do is install the Gem:

    gem install betterroutes


### Usage ###

    rake broutes


### Documentation / Support ###

Not much -- it's pretty simple.

Be sure to check out the Wiki for updates.  If you have a patch, be sure to submit it!
